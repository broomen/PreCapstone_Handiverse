# PreCapstone_Handiverse
Handiverse is an application made with Java and JavaFX, and utilizes a database for data storage.

It's primary function is to track and display accessibility information of various locations in the NYC boroughs.
This includes things such as wheelchair accessibility, noise levels, visually impaired accomodations, and more.

It was a school project for my Fall 2021 class "Pre-Capstone Innovation". At this time there is no plan for further development or deployment.

The essential loop of usage is for the user to arrive at the home screen and enter a keyword they'd like to search for (such as location name or a specific tag they're looking for, such as "wheelchair), and then enter a location to search near. If no location is entered, it defaults to the NYU Tandon campus. 

After the user searches, they will find a list returned on a new page that displays the various locations. The user can filter these further and then click on the location to view it's page.

Once on the page, the user can leave reviews or read reviews, endorse tags and reviews made by other users, or return to the previous screen.

Things I would like to add in the future if I revisit this project would be to further develop the user account system to increase security and reliability, as well as compiling the whole project into a deployable application or make it capable to be deployed as a website.
